          <h1 id="title">Brotherhood</h1>
        <p id="paragraph">It was pouring heavily,my hands felt numb. I needed to head to the gym but figured I needed a detour. I began sprinting. My feet started getting heavy from soaking up the rain. My breath tightened. The drops of rain enlarged,the street lights lit up. I step inside. My hands feel less restricted,my breaths slow down,I take off my wet shoes and place them on the shelf. “Assalamu Alaikum” “Wa alaikum assalam” I head to the bathroom. I washed my hands and began making wudu. “haya alaa alsalah… haya alaa alsalah… haya alaa alfalah… haya ealaa alfalah.” I quickly dried myself up and lined with my fellow brothers. Shoulder to shoulder,toe to toe. “Allahu Akbar.” I greet my brother to my right then to my left,smiling from ear to ear. You could hear drops of rain in the background and small chattering as people were exiting. I feel relieved. I feel at ease. I feel a sense of belonging.
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">“Yo Omar,you can’t eat this right?” A student waves a piece of bacon to my face with a smirk.
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">“Yo Omar,you can’t drink right now because It’s Ramadan right?” A student proceeds to drink water right in front of me.
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">“Yo Omar,you know what happened on 9/11?</p>
        <p id="paragraph">“Yo Omar,why does your people always gotta be blowing sh*t up”
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">“They say that Oklahoma bombing  could be associate with a Middle-Eastern terrorist.”
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">“If you have people coming out of mosques with hatred and death in their eyes and in their minds,we’re going to have to do something.” </p>
        <p id="paragraph">A lot of people’s perception of Islam comes from the media.
          In class I feel out of place,in the mosque I feel welcomed.
          In class I feel as though I’m misunderstood,in the mosque people can relate more than just a religious standpoint.
          </p>
        <p id="paragraph">In class people associate with me as a classmate,in the mosque I’m referred to everyone as their brother.
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">Some people see it as just a plain brownstone building like the rest of the block,I see it as a place where Muslims can feel comfortable in their own beliefs. I’ll always feel proud to see that little banner that says Masjid Al dawood. As people started observing what was happening beyond the doors of a plain old building,diversity reached new heights. People had different backgrounds but the same belief. People might have physical disabilities but in the mosque their hearts feel accessible to the community that appreciates them. </p>
        <p id="paragraph">When I was young,my father would take me there on fridays. I rather stayed in bed but was forced to go.
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">“Stay strong with your religion” he told me when he noticed I was slacking in keeping in touch with my religion.
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">When we get there,Sunlight fills up the area. The elders reading the Quran. Toddlers holding onto their father’s index finger as they seem thrilled to be there.
          Smiles,hand gestures,greetings was all I saw.
          </p>
        <p id="paragraph">They would greet me with a firm handshake “Assalamu Alaikum ” (peace be upon you). I smiled and replied “Walaikum Assalam” (and may peace be upon you). </p>
        <p id="paragraph">We all line up,shoulder to shoulder,toe to toe. “Allahu Akbar.”</p>
        <p id="paragraph">After prayer,I saw my friends “Assalamu Alaikum” “Walaikum assalam.”
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">The weird stares,the disgusted facial expressions. How quickly the neighbors walk by with their heads facing down after seeing us. Gripping their child's hand as they jaywalk right when they are in the vicinity of the mosque.</p>
        <p id="paragraph">For some they see a normal building written Masjid Al- Dawood,they see straight faces with bushy beards,Long robes,disturbing the neighborhood with an obnoxious chant.
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">“What are they doing?”</p>
        <p id="paragraph">“What's with all the noise?” </p>
        <p id="paragraph">“Allahu akbar” (Allah is the greatest)
          beautiful words are being vocalized through a microphone so it can be heard throughout the neighborhood.
          </p>
        <p id="paragraph">suspicious looks were all given from the neighbors as though we were plotting something awful against them. Some look at the Masjid in awe. “Wow,what a beautiful religion.” “If you don’t mind me asking,what’s the reason you guys all pray together in one line?”
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">When people ask me “why do you believe in Islam?” “Why can’t you just go to your local park?”
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">For me it’s knowing deep in my heart when I greet a person inside the mosque,I’m treated with the utmost respect. </p>
        <p id="paragraph">It’s the late night conversion after breaking my fast with the person next to me. </p>
        <p id="paragraph">It’s waking up early in the morning during Eid so I could hear the sheik preach while everybody is listening with their undivided attention.
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">It’s deciding with my friends that it would be a good idea to chill in the mosque and have engaging conversations about Islam. </p>
        <p id="paragraph">It’s the moment when I leave the mosque,I still feel attached to it. I still feel that a part of me still remains inside that mosque.
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">And It all begins with just a simple greeting… Assalamu Alaikum.
